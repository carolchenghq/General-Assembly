# Capstone Project: Data Driven Strategy of Bank Marketing

## About the dataset

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

The dataset is available in https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing.

## Goals

- Targeting existing clients for the marketing campaigns.
- Targeting potential clients for the marketing campaigns.

---

## Solutions

- Build machine learning models to classify the existing clients. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) the term deposit.
- Analyze the data to find out what kind of people would be the potential clients for this specific product, and what factors influence people's decision of the subscription.
